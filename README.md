this is my answer to the questions mentioned in the test.
the 1st question is by the name of : ToDoApp
the 2nd question is by the name of: Pages, 
the to-do list satisfied all teh criteria given in the question.
but, the API list display question crashes everytime I import the url of the API, so it is not complete but half-done.
it also dos not support jw-vue-pagination.
